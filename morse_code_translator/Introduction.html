       <h2>What is Morse Code?</h2> </div>
</div>
<div class="card">
   <p>Morse code is a character-encoding scheme that allows <br> to send messages using a series of electrical<br>pulses represented as short or long pulses, dots, and dashes.The codes are transmitted as electrical pulses of varied lengths or analogous mechanical or visual signals, such as flashing lights. The two systems are the original “American” Morse Code and the later International Morse Code, which became the global standard.</p>

         <h2>Who Invented Morse Code?</h2>
</div>
         <div class="carda">
         <p>Samuel F. B. Morse is known to have invented Morse code.One of the systems was invented in the United States by American artist and inventor Samuel F.B. Morse during the 1830s for electrical telegraphy. This version was further improved by American scientist and businessman Alfred Lewis Vail, Morse’s assistant and partner. Soon after its introduction in Europe, it became apparent that the original Morse Code was inadequate for the transmission of much non-English text, since it lacked codes for letters with diacritic marks. To remedy this deficiency, a variant called the International Morse Code was devised by a conference of European nations in 1851. This newer code is also called Continental Morse Code.</p>

    <h2>What Was the First Message Sent by Morse Code?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="cardb">
    <p>"What hath God wrought" was the first official message sent by Samuel F.B. Morse on May 24, 1844, to open the Baltimore-Washington telegraph line.When decoded, this paper tape recording of the historic message transmitted by Samuel F. B. Morse reads, "What hath God wrought?" Morse sent it from the Supreme Court room in the U.S. Capitol in Washington to his assistant, Alfred Vail, in Baltimore. Morse's early system produced a paper copy with raised dots and dashes, which were translated later by an operator. Across the top of this artifact of his historic achievement Morse has given credit to Annie Ellsworth, the young daughter of a good friend, for suggesting the message he sent. She found it in the Bible, Numbers 23:23.

   <h2>What is Morse Code Used For?</h2>
</div>
   <div class="cardc">
   <p> Morse code had extensive usage in the past, especially in the military.Dots and dashes can easily be encoded for Morse code.
      Easy communication across long distances.
It also Played a critical role in World War II for the NAVY. It was more secure and traveled a longer distance than voice telephone! </p>

      <h2>How to Use Morse Code?</h2>
   </div>
   <div class="cardd">
  <p>Morse code can be used in various ways, such as with pen and paper or with the aid of light and sound. It can even be used with parts of the body like the eyes or fingers. Morse Code uses an alphabet made up of dots and dashes (for instance, the letter "s" is three dots and "o" is three dashes.) It is used by tapping the combination of dots and dashes needed and pausing for the correct gap duration. There are longer gaps between words than letters in a word.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="carde">
        <p>You can learn the Morse code by studying and listening to Morse audio, as well as through word memorization techniques you can find on various websites. However, one of the best Morse code learning methods is the Gboard keyboard, which was developed by Google. With the "learn Morse" exercises provided by Google Creative Lab, you can even practice online for free.<p>
